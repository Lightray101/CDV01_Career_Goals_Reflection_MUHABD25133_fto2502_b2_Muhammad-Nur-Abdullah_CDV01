### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:

##   Strengths:
    - I am able to use HTML really well as of right now and have a good grip on basic CSS and able to read a lot of basic code without being confused or lost.
    - Getting a hand of code much quicker and without doubting myself as much.
    - Able to build a simple website on my own.
    
##   Weaknesses:
    - More complex parts of CSS such as flexbox and grid are not sitting with me as of yet. While practicing I still find myself confused at times even with guidance.
    - Inconsistent with the amount of time I spend coding at times which throws my learning process off.
    - 
 1. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - I found software development astonishing. Being able to build applications and websites on our own or in a team. I am interested in the more web developing section as I love building what I see as my own world which I can adjust and make usable for the users who I       see as the residents of this world I built. 
    - Values that are important to me in a workplace are effective communication as I do not want any confusion as to what my task is or my teams. I need to know what to do so I am not hesitant or make too many mistakes.
    - Another would be that I would love a more comfortable environment where all my colleagues and I each have a respective workspace which isn't too seperate to allow for communication and comfortability.

### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - CodeSpace
    - Network Recruitment ( Based in Century City  Cape Town )
    - Junior Web developers are in need at Network Recruitment and are willing to aid in their junior developers coding journey. 
     
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - Both companies align with my personal belief of constant improvement in code. Keeping up to date and wanting to make sure everything is as good as it can be showing a great deal of professionalism and care for thier users.
    - It aligns with my skills as I am practicing to develop websites from the coding langauges expected from them including HTML, CSS and JS which is the language I am yet to learn.
    - The only issue I have identified is that the requirement is 1-2 years of experience for these positions instead of a proper internship.

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - I would love to be able to design a few complex websites comfortably without too much issues. Nothing insanely impressive but something big enough to display my skills.
    - Understanding how to apply HTML and CSS fluently without seeking out guidance too much as I would like to be able to handle projects with understanding.
    - Learn javascript to enhance my skills and web developing and to secure jobs easier as it is the most requested language. It also is one of if not the hardest language to learn so conquering it would boost my confidence in my code.
      
2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Becoming fluent in building websites. Understanding how to apply all the different styles of code in a given scenario to ensure I reach my maximum potential as soon as I can and be a asset to whatever company I end up working for.
    - I would love to become a mentor and spread my knowledge and skills to any junior developers. Making them feel comfortable in their struggles.
    - I would also love to have mastered responsive design to make my websites as professional and accessible as possible.
   

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Practice daily on my own without looking at any resources to see how much of the content I remember.
    - Using Scrimba to help me build websites or simple programmes as practice.
    - Watching YouTube tutorials of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to ensure I know how to apply and use it.
    - Using the resources provided to me by CodeSpace Academy to expand my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS.
    
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - I will have to ensure I stay consistent with practicing my code and web developing as a whole.
    - I need to optimize my performance and compare my code to that of a more experienced individual to learn what I can use to improve mine.
    - Becoming a full stack developer for more flexibility in what I can do and provide for a organization.
    - Learning extra skills and programmes like C# and have experience with unit testing.
